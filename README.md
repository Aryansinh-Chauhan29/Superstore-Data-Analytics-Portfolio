# Superstore Data Analytics Portfolio

## Objective
Comprehensive analysis of the Sample – Superstore dataset to extract actionable insights on sales, customers, and products using Python, MySQL, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Analyses Performed
1. **Unique Customer Cities** – List all cities where customers are located.  
2. **Total Sales per Sub-Category** – Identify top-performing product sub-categories.  
3. **Customer Count per State** – Understand customer distribution by region.  
4. **Orders per Month** – Track monthly sales trends.  
5. **Average Products per Order by City** – Analyze customer purchase patterns.  
6. **Revenue Contribution by Product Category** – Determine category-wise revenue share.  
7. **Correlation Between Product Price & Purchase Frequency** – Study pricing trends.  
8. **Moving Average of Customer Order Values** – Track spending trends over time.  
9. **Cumulative Monthly Sales (2014–2017)** – Observe revenue growth over multiple years.  
10. **Year-over-Year Sales Growth Rate** – Identify expanding or declining periods.  
11. **Customer Retention Rate** – Percentage of repeat purchases within 6 months.  
12. **Top 3 Customers per Year** – Highlight key revenue contributors annually.  
13. **Top 5 States by Profit Margins & Discounts** – Identify profitable regions.  
14. **Profit-to-Sales Ratio per Sub-Category** – Evaluate product profitability.  
15. **Top 5 Consistently Growing Customers** – Customers with steadily increasing spend.  
16. **RFM Segmentation** – Classify customers into loyalty tiers: Champions, Loyal, Potential, Needs Attention, At Risk.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- MySQL (for data extraction)  
- Jupyter Notebook
